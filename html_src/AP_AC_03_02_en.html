      <h3 class="heading-level2">Tax Refunds on shopping at a franchise</h3>
      <ul class="list1">
        <li class="list1-item">
          If you are considering receiving a tax refund, verify before making a purchase that the store is one of the refund-eligible franchises. After making your purchase (over 30,000 KRW), present your passport to a store employee and fill out a tax refund form. You must possess both the refund form issued by the store and the receipt of purchase.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="guide-desc mark mt10">
        Even if you make a purchase at an eligible store, you cannot receive a refund if you do not fill out the tax refund form. The same applies if the form is incomplete, so please carefully check.

      <ul class="list1">
        <li class="list1-item">
          Passengers intending to apply for a tax refund at the departure airport should leave more time to get to the airport.
        </li>
        <li class="list1-item">
          Check-in with your airline and receive the boarding pass. Keep the related forms and documents with you instead of in the checked bag.
        </li>
        <li class="list1-item">
          Submit your passport, list of purchased goods (only unopened, unused items), and receipt to receive the stamp on the Tax Refund Form at the Customs desk.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="guide-desc mark mt10">
        In the case of wanting to check the purchased goods as checked baggage: notify the airline employee at the time of check-in that you have tax refund-eligible goods in your baggage. The employee will attach a checked baggage tag and return the bag to you. Take the bag to the Customs desk to verify the goods and receive the Customs stamp of approval. Afterwards, you can drop off the bag with the checked baggage tag  in the oversized baggage conveyor belt.

      <ul class="list1">
        <li class="list1-item">
          Please visit the Tax Refund Counter to submit the tax refund confirmation form with the Customs stamp and receive the refund immediately on the spot.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="guide-desc mark mt10">
        In the case that you arrive outside of operating hours of the Refund Counter or if you did not have time before departure to get a refund even with the Customs stamp, please submit your form in the Refund Box. After review, the refund will be sent to you by mail or through direct deposit.
