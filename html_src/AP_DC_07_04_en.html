                  Take the Maglev Train all the way to the final stop (Yongyu Station) and cross one street to meet the wide ocean. Not only can you enjoy the beautiful scenery that changes with the ebb and flow of the tide, but there also is a variety of food you can try. Maglev makes your trip to the Seaside Market, Masiran Beach, and Muui/Small Muui/Silmi Islands easy. If you take Bus 306 in front of Youngyu Station, you can easily visit Eul-wang-ri and the Fairy Rock.
