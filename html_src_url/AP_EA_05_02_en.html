        <li class="list1-item">
          If you are considering receiving a tax refund, verify before making a purchase that the store is one of the refund-eligible franchises. After making your purchase (over 30,000 KRW), present your passport to a store employee and request a tax refund form. You must possess both the refund form issued by the store and the receipt of purchase until departure.

      <p class="guide-desc mark color mt10">
        In the case that you arrive outside of operating hours of the Refund Counter or if you did not have time before departure to get a refund even with the Customs stamp, please submit your form in the Refund Box. After review, the refund will be sent to you by mail or through direct deposit.
